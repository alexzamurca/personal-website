            Software is based around manipulating notification times to remind a user when an anime they are watching is
going to release a new episode. Skills learned: interacting with REST and GraphQL APIs, manipulating data received
from a website to get relevant information(JSON), creating a user interface in Android Studio using XML, familiarity
with core and some advanced Android functionality (some examples include fragments, alarm managers and
dialogs), creating an API using Dropwizard and JDBC, managing local databases, SQL commands.

            Using APIs like Google's speech recognition, Google maps, Spotify, and others to create a virtual assistant that
allows basic control of the user's machine and services they may choose to use. Skills learned: researching existing
apps and innovating on them, using system resources efficiently, adapting, and learning to use third-party APIs.
Features of the software include: playing songs on Spotify and controlling the client, controlling system sound,
opening apps on the user's computer, searching the internet, having a conversation with the user, implementing a
graphical user interface, and others.

            I am interested in software development and hope to expose myself to several programming languages and
software tools in hope of finding a field to specialise in. To achieve this, I am currently undertaking courses to learn
HTML, CSS and JavaScript while attempting to create a website.
        <br>
Since coming to Bath, I developed a passion for volleyball. Volleyball is a game that encourages and expects players
to work together towards predicting and overcoming challenges produced by the opposition. Also, it is essential to
communicate clearly and effectively, making sure the team avoids mistakes as much as possible. Badminton is
another sport I actively play that teaches intuition and the ability to be competent as an individual.
