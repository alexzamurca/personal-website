        <p>
            I am interested in software development and hope to expose myself to several programming languages and
software tools in hope of finding a field to specialise in. To achieve this, I am currently undertaking courses to learn
HTML, CSS and JavaScript while attempting to create a website.
        <br>
Since coming to Bath, I developed a passion for volleyball. Volleyball is a game that encourages and expects players
to work together towards predicting and overcoming challenges produced by the opposition. Also, it is essential to
communicate clearly and effectively, making sure the team avoids mistakes as much as possible. Badminton is
another sport I actively play that teaches intuition and the ability to be competent as an individual.
